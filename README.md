# Generate-Team-Profile

The purpose of this project was to get us to use what have learnt in the previous lessons and apply it to a more practical scenario.

This project allowed us to practice using inquirer, classes, jest tests and Node.js. We were given starter code to work with however we had to make it a fully functional command-line application. This application starts by prompting the user a series of questions relating to employee information. Once the user has finished answering the questions a HTML will be generated using the data provided. Finally we needed to use jest to test that all of our classes were working as intended.

This project required us to hit the following requirements;

* Create a command-line application that accepts accepts user input using the provided starter code.   
  * Create classes for each team member provided and export them. The tests for these classes (in the `_tests_` directory) must ALL pass.     
    * The first class is an `Employee` parent class with the following properties and methods:       
      * `name`
      * `id`
      * `email`
      * `getName()`
      * `getId()`
      * `getEmail()`
      * `getRole()`&mdash;returns `'Employee'`     
    * The other three classes will extend `Employee`.      
    * In addition to `Employee`'s properties and methods, `Manager` will also have the following:
      * `officeNumber`
      * `getRole()`&mdash;overridden to return `'Manager'`
    * In addition to `Employee`'s properties and methods, `Engineer` will also have the following:
      * `github`&mdash;GitHub username
      * `getGithub()`
      * `getRole()`&mdash;overridden to return `'Engineer'`
    * In addition to `Employee`'s properties and methods, `Intern` will also have the following:
      * `school`
      * `getSchool()`
      * `getRole()`&mdash;overridden to return `'Intern'`
    * Finally, although it’s not a requirement, consider adding validation to ensure that user input is in the proper format.   
  * Write code in `index.js` that uses inquirer to gather information about the development team members and creates objects for each team member using the correct classes as blueprints.
    * When a user starts the application then they are prompted to enter the **team manager**’s:
      * Name
      * Employee ID
      * Email address
      * Office number
    * When a user enters those requirements then the user is presented with a menu with the option to:
      * Add an engineer
      * Add an intern 
      * Finish building the team
    * When a user selects the **engineer** option then a user is prompted to enter the following and then the user is taken back to the menu:
      * Engineer's Name
      * ID
      * Email
      * GitHub username
    * When a user selects the intern option then a user is prompted to enter the following and then the user is taken back to the menu:
      * Intern’s name
      * ID
      * Email
      * School
    * When a user decides to finish building their team then they exit the application, and the HTML is generated.
  * Call the `render` function (provided for you) and pass in an array containing all employee objects; 
    * The `render` function will generate and return a block of HTML including templated divs for each employee!
  * Create an HTML file using the HTML returned from the `render` function. 
    * Write it to a file named `team.html` in the `output` folder. 
    * You can use the provided variable `outputPath` to target this location.
